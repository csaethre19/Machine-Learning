### Machine Learning

Items in this repository are my submitted assignments for the course MATH 7960 (cross listed as CS 6955). 
The course design and materials are based largely on the course CS231n taught at Stanford.

HW 1: Naive and vectorized implementations of KNN, SVM, Softmax, and fully connected two layer neural network.
